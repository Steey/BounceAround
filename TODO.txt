TO DO:

* Add proper complex object collision detection and handling OR just implement collision detection for basic shapes (like ELLIPSE, RECT, LINE etc.)
* Add object texturing OR just display an image in place of the object (but maintain collision box of a proper PShape idk)
* Implement a system handling the variable game FPS vs display FPS
* Rework the jump mechanic (so that it's impossible to jump again in mid air)
* Rework the ball control to improve input responsiveness
* Convert TODO.txt to Github Project or Milestones?
* Add game modes (Play, Level editor, etc...)
